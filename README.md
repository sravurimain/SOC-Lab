<h1>SOC Lab</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project involves setting up a comprehensive Security Operations Center (SOC) Lab environment. The lab is designed to simulate real-world cybersecurity scenarios and provide hands-on experience with various security tools and techniques. It includes components such as log management, intrusion detection systems, and vulnerability scanners. While it doesn't include a SIEM due to pricing considerations, this lab environment still allows users to practice threat detection, incident response, and security monitoring in a controlled home setting.
